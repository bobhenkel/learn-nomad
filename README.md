# learn-nomad
Repo to capture my learnings with nomad(https://www.nomadproject.io)

I come from the land of Kubernetes with a viewpoint biased from it. I want to open my mind to something else and see what I can learn.

Initial questions in no specific order:

* Is there a kubectl run command?
* Is there a kubectl exec command?
* Are there namespaces like k8s? Yes
* Is there a quick way to expose a service on a host port like k8s when you don't have a way to update DNS records?
* Is there kubectl proxy like command?
* Is there a kubectl port-forward like command?
